    "# Structural Pattern Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.10 was released on 4th October 2021 and introduces [several new features](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html) and improvements to the language. One of the biggest new introductions is structural pattern matching, which on the face of it is similar to case, switch, or match statements in other languages. Python 3.10 has its own twist on this however with some nifty new approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate python structural pattern matching we can think about parsing a [logo program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) as an example. A great way to learn and play with the logo language is [Turtle Academy](https://turtleacademy.com/).\n",

    "This allows us to capture the amount as an instance of int, rather than matching anything which is given in this position. [PEP-634](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0634/) defines that the following types will work in this way: `bool`, `bytearray`, `bytes`, `dict`, `float`, `frozenset`, `int`, `list`, `set`, `str`, and `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a convenience, for these builtin types it is also possible to capture directly within the type by using a positional parameter. The following snippet is equivalent to the previous example:"

    "Structural pattern matching is a long awaited new feature for the python language which finally cleans up those pesky long `if-elif-else` blocks with hidden logic inside them. The way matching works is very intuitive to those who are familiar with tuple unpacking, and should remove many use cases where people reach for the dreaded regex package.\n",

    "\n",
    "PyLint C0103 is a really helpful message to catch some really simple, obvious naming convention violations. However, it doesnâ€™t catch everything that is defined within the [official python naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions). For example, at time of writing, PyLint confuses a `TypeVar` as a Class name, and raises the naming convention message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good names make it easier for others to follow, maintain, and improve your code. It is always worth fixing these convention messages, and practicing writing code in a more pythonic way."
